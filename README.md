## Overview

Wakey-Wakey is being built in Stanford University's EE272B: Design Projects in
VLSI Systems II.

It is expected to be submitted for tapeout in June 2021 as part of
Skywater Foundry's SKY130 MPW-TWO shuttle program.

Packaged die are expected to be received by December 2021.

### Structure
The project is structured as follows:

- `img` contains images for use in documentation throughout the project

- `py` contains software models in Python for our acoustic featurization
   pipeline and DNN accelerator

- `rtl` contains RTL source files and associated testbenches. Further details on
   RTL architecture and running the testbenches can be found in this repo.
